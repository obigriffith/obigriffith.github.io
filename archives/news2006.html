  <p>19 Dec 06 - I'll be heading to the interior for holidays soon so I thought I'd make a quick report. Gonna do some skiing, visit some family, and otherwise just chill out. I just noticed this <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/548611">article in Reuters Health</a> about <a href="http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/31/5043">my paper on thyroid cancer</a>. I helped Dr. Wiseman write up the quotes you see throughout the article. But, I guess it doesn't sound as impressive to say, &quot;Mr. Griffith, a lowly graduate student said...&quot;. Haha. Anyways, I thought it was cool that Reuters actually noticed our research and published a short article on it. In ORegAnno news, we finally have an official track in UCSC, added a new dataset from the <a href="http://enhancer.lbl.gov/">Vista Enhancer Browser</a> (with help from Max), and created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORegAnno">Wikipedia entry for ORegAnno</a>. In terms of minor updates, I've added an item to my publications and moved <a href="archives/news2005.html">older news from 2005</a> to an archived page so that this one doesn't just keep getting longer and longer. </p>
  <p>4 Dec 06 - Ouch. The whole month of November snuck by without a single update. I guess I've been busy. I was getting ready for the <a href="http://www.dmbr.ugent.be/bioit/contents/regcreative/index.php">RegCreative Jamboree</a> in Belgium and took off for some holidays in the Netherlands beforehand. I posted some pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594400217222/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594400214851/">Ghent</a> on my Flickr site. I've also hosted some pictures of the trip courtesy of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594400260987/">Monica</a>. We had a lot of fun (as I hope you can tell from the pictures) in both Amsterdam and Ghent. You just can't beat the selection of good beers, great cheeses, fancy gin, great coffee everywhere, and friendly people. The conference itself was a great success too. We managed to annotate several hundred records and nearly 100 papers. There was also a lot of good discussion around the annotation standards, incorporation of ontologies, text-mining challenges, inter-annotator analysis, and interface improvements for ORegAnno. In summary it was a great success I think. </p>
  <p>23 October 06 - I finally added some new pictures to my flickr site. These were taken the hard way and developed manually in the darkroom. I forgot how much work traditional photography is. I got out the old pentax 35mm, a macro lens, and my tripod and headed down to Queen Elizabeth park. Took a bunch of closeups of flowers and such. Unfortunately, it was way too bright that day so a lot of my pictures were a little overexposed. I have a decent light meter, but on a day like that, it just says, &quot;man its bright out here!&quot;. Getting back into the dark room for the first time in five years was like starting from scratch. Fun though. There are so many variables between taking the picture and the final product. You've got the aperture, shutter speed and focus when you take the picture; developing time, concentrations, and temperature while you're developing the negatives; then aperture, focus and filter grade on the enlarger; exposure time for the prints, and finally scanner settings. And of course, photoshop lets you change the digital image in a million ways. I bet there's also that many steps (or more) between light hitting an image and your brain processing it. Its a wonder that two people can ever agree on what they see given all the variations that likely exist in each of those processing steps. Anyways, after several hours of figuring out all of the above, here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594341592972/">my first attempts in the darkroom</a>. My scanner didn't do a great job (making the images a little too dark) and I didn't yet avail myself of the aforemetioned photoshop features. But, you get the idea. </p>
  <p>20 October 06 - Made a few updates to CV and publications. Since last posting I also checked out <a href="http://www.marianastrench.net/">Marianas Trench</a> at their CD release party. They were pretty solid. In the sad news department, our friend and fellow grad student Adrian has passed away. He was a cool guy. One of the rare ones who can actually balance academic pursuits with social and creative. If you've never checked out <a href="http://www.q-theory.com/">his music</a> I've uploaded <a href="http://obiweb.bcgsc.ca/files/qtheory.zip">mp3s from his album</a>. Enjoy.</p>
  <p>9 October 06 - Went to the <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/delirium/intro/intro_default.htm">Cirque Du Soleil &quot;Delirium&quot;</a> show. It was awesome. A big thanks to the <a href="http://www.bccancerfoundation.com/cms/">BC Cancer Foundation</a> for providing free tickets to hundreds of their staff. We had row four seats on the floor. Close enough to see the chalk dust fly and the sweat dripping of a fifteen foot tall stilt-walking monster. The music was good, the acrobatics were amazing, and the show mesmerizing. Now, after a thanksgiving gorging, its back to work. Boo to working on a long-weekend monday holiday.</p>
  <p>28 September 06 - Damn a whole month since posting anything. There must be lots of news. I went to the <a href="http://www.snowpatrol.com/">Snow Patrol</a> concert last weekend. It was fairly awesome. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miss604/sets/72157594296473903/">PNE Forum</a> is not the greatest venue ever and the encore was really short (two songs) but it was cool to see them live. Also saw the <a href="http://suicidegirls.com/">Suicide Girls</a> last week. They were awesome. The crowd was really intense. The show seemed much more professional than the last time they came through Vancouver. </p>
  <p>28 August 06 - My thyroid cancer meta-analysis paper was accepted for publication in JCO. Sweet!</p>
  <p>21 August 06 - Just made a few minor updates to publications and stuff. There must be lots of new since I posted last (if only because its been so long). I went on a weekend trip to Vegas, gambled a little, had a few drinks, and hung out by the pool at the <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/">MGM Grand</a>. Sorry no pictures of that trip ;). I resubmitted my revised thyroid meta-analysis to JCO. Still waiting with fingers crossed. I saw <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com/">Sarah Harmer </a>last night at<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=malkin+bowl&m=text"> Malkin Bowl</a>. A nice venue and really <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/megownsengland/sets/72157594245203927/">good show</a>. Just listening to her new album now. Lately I've become mildly obsessed with the inane web dramas and amateur videos of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. Any YouTubers out there no what I'm talking about. Other than that, not much to report. </p>
  <p>29 June 06 - Advertising and interest for the <a href="http://www.dmbr.ugent.be/bioit/contents/regcreative/index.php">RegCreative jamboree</a> is starting to heat up. Items were featured on the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/news_events/view.php?a_id=31">UBiC</a> news and events page and the <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/">GenomeWeb Daily News</a> events page. <a href="http://www.oreganno.org/oregano/Index.jsp">ORegAnno</a> also hit an exciting milestone with 500 unique publications annotated. </p>
  <p>19 June 06 - The new <a href="http://www.dmbr.ugent.be/bioit/contents/regcreative/index.php">RegCreative jamboree</a> webpage is online now. This is the name for the ORegAnno annotation workshop that I will be attending in November at Ghent University.</p>
  <p>16 June 06 - Just got tickets to <a href="http://www.snowpatrol.com/">Snow Patrol</a> at the <a href="http://www.pne.ca/showsandevents/concerts_and_events.htm">PNE Forum</a> for September! If you haven't heard them before check em out. Also, a friend and colleague just had his music profiled on <a href="http://www.ubl.com/genres/electronic/">UBL (the ultimate band list)</a> and made it onto their top 100 chart. He's called <a href="http://www.q-theory.com/">Q-theory</a> and has some really interesting electronica. If you want to check it out visit his <a href="http://www.ubl.com/artists/qtheory/">UBL profile</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/qtheory">myspace.com</a> page, or <a href="http://www.q-theory.com/">official site</a>. I'm heading out camping on Okanagan lake in just 3 hours. The weather isn't looking great but I'm super excited to go camping for the first time this summer. Can't concentrate. That's probably why I'm updating my webpage instead of working. Also, updated my <a href="publications.html">pubs</a> page with abstracts, posters and presentations (pdf or ppt). Nothing too exciting there.</p>
  <p>13 June 06 - Hi again. I just got back from Winnipeg. Had a great time visiting family and presenting a poster at the <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/research_days/index/">Canadian Student Health Research Forum</a> poster competition put on by CIHR. The weather was mostly sunny allowing for some good golfing and a swim in lake Winnipeg (still a bit frosty. No pictures available from Winnipeg yet but I did post a few <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598903/">new pictures of the house</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/158371801/in/set-1598903/">new fern garden</a>. In other exciting news, JCO seems open to publishing my thyroid meta-analysis paper if we can address the reviewers concerns.</p>
  <p>18 May 06 - Wow. Haven't gone this long between posts for ages. Since my last post I think I did <a href="http://www.vanbug.org/?page_id=8">my VanBUG talk</a> (notice my name as a footnote after Jason Stajich). After that, I squeezed a little work in then it was off to <a href="http://www.cshl.edu/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories</a> for the <a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings/genome06.shtml">Biology of Genomes</a> meeting in New York. I've added a bunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594135779369/">pictures</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594135779369/">my Flickr website</a> in a set called '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594135779369/">New York 2006</a>'. A great meeting with lots of interesting ideas and contacts made. In particular, there seemed a fair amount of interest in the <a href="http://www.oreganno.org/oregano/Index.jsp">ORegAnno</a> project. A jamboree has been planned for three days of non-stop <a href="http://www.oreganno.org/oregano/Index.jsp">ORegAnno</a> annotation this fall at <a href="http://www.ugent.be/">Ghent University</a> in Belgium. If someone told me even two years ago that my first trip to Europe would be for a meeting dedicated to curating regulatory sequences from the scientific literature and adding them to a database called <a href="http://www.oreganno.org/oregano/Index.jsp">ORegAnno</a>, I would have said 'maybe you've been smoking a little too much oregano. But, who cares, I can't wait! For news on the home front, the main thing is the addition of a shade garden to the flowerbed along the front walkway. Hopefully I'll have some pictures of that soon. We planted a nice collection of hostas, ferns, astilbe, poppies, and an iris with black lava rock as the ground cover. When it fills in it should look really cool. Anyways, that's all for now. ttyl. </p>
  <p>10 Apr 06 - Back in Vancouver. Feels good to have access to good sushi again. Added lots more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594098743660/">Washington DC</a> pics to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">my flickr page</a>. I particularly liked <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/125384049/in/set-72057594098743660/">this one</a> of a Sugimoto photo mural in the <a href="http://hirshhorn.si.edu/">Hirshhorn gallery</a>. That guy is amazing. Other favorites include this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/124694813/in/set-72057594098743660/">nightshot at the World War II Memorial</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/124695252/in/set-72057594098743660/">crazy water droplets</a> at the National Botanical Gardens, and this bit of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/124695151/in/set-72057594098743660/">modern art wing of the National Gallery of Art</a>. If you ever get a chance I highly recommend the US capitol for a visit. So many museums and galleries and they're all free. I've also updated my <a href="CV.html">CV</a> and <a href="publications.html">publications</a> slightly.</p>
  <p>4 Apr 06 - Hi from DC. I'm currently at the <a href="http://www.aacr.org/">American Association of Cancer Researchers </a>annual conference in Washington. Its a ridiculously large conference on all things cancer. I've put a few pictures on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594098743660/">my flick page</a> of the conference and some site-seeing I've done. After the conference I'm hoping to do it fair bit more. </p>
  <p>22 Mar 06 - <a href="http://egweb.bcgsc.ca/personal/BonVoyage/">Pics</a> from potluck at Clark drive. <a href="http://egweb.bcgsc.ca/personal/BonVoyage/">Bon voyage Erin</a>! We fit 12 people into our living/dining room for dinner. <a href="images/bon_voyage2.jpg">cozy</a>.</p>
  <p>13 Mar 06 - Wow. Its been a whole month since reporting. That almost doesn't seem possible. Let's see. What's new. Posted some more pictures on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">Flikr page</a> a while back (mostly old pictures). Had a birthday/house-warming party this weekend. Broke in the new renovations without doing too much permanent damage and got a great new bbq from the gang. In research news, things continue to progress steadily. I've made a number of upates to my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> section. Our GC bias paper was accepted at NAR (with revisions - thankfully I won't be doing them). Our subspace clustering paper was submitted to KDD on friday. And, hopefully today our thyroid meta-analysis paper will be submitted to JCI. </p>
  <p>13 Feb 06 - Just posted some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594063963303/">pictures from Sun Peaks</a> (courtesy of CL). This is from the second day of skiing when I decided to try boarding. Had some great runs and started to get the hang of it. But, now I feel like someone kicked the crap out of me. Everything hurts. Snowboarding definitely involves a lot more falling than skiing. The $5 helmet rental paid for itself many times over. </p>
  <p>7 Feb 06 - Lets see. What's new. The ski trip to Sun Peaks is this weekend. Woooohooo. Almost finished organizing the garage so that we can put the car back in it. That's a major milestone. One and a half years later we're moved into the house. You can see some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598827/">before</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598903/">after</a> pictures on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">my flikr page</a>. </p>
  <p>27 Jan 06 - Went to the coldplay concert last night. Not as good as U2 but still really good. Lots of shameless but amusing references to how great Canada is. <br>
&quot;And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville... but nobody rocks like -- [consults note taped to back of guitar] -- Springfield!&quot;<br>
  They had a nice screen behind the stage for cool effects. And, entertaining props like giant yellow balloons. The balloons were filled with glitter and made some cool sparkling effects when the popped. They also had some ant-sized people jumping around on stage with a lot of enthusiasm. But, most importantly the music and sound were incredible. </p>
  <p>18 Jan 06 - Well I'm back in soggy Vancouver. Its good to be home but I miss Maui already. When we were landing the pilot said it had been raining for two months. I'm not sure if he was joking - apparently we almost broke a record. I've put a bunch more pictures from Maui on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">my Flikr page</a> courtesy of Carri, Kim, and Erin. On the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/">sets page</a> there's a large set of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1766560/">all Maui</a> pictures and subsets of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050559473/">favorites</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050486306/">skies and sunsets</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050489585/">beaches</a>, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050553871/">Grand Wailea</a> where we attended the conference, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050556818/">La Perouse Bay and some lava fields</a>, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050511651/">road to Hana</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050553049/">West Maui</a>, and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594050491065/">Olivine Pools</a>. </p>
  <p>5 Jan 06 - aloha again. The ORegAnno paper is now available online at <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/papbyrecent.dtl">Bioinformatics Advance Access</a>. I also just put some pics from CL on my flikr page. If you want to get a taste of Maui <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1766560/">take a look</a>. </p>
  <p>4 Jan 06 - Aloha. Just a quick note from Maui. I'm sitting in very air conditioned conference room at the <a href="http://www.grandwailea.com/">Grand Wailea</a> resort at the <a href="http://psb.stanford.edu/">PSB conference</a>. Benjamin Good just gave a really nice talk that generated a lot of interest (the only line up at the microphone for questions I've seen so far). You can see his presentation at his <a href="http://bioinfo.icapture.ubc.ca/bgood/">home page</a>. Currently Eric neumann and Dennis Quan are presenting an interesting talk on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/04/swls/BioDash/Demo/">BioDASH</a>, a semantic web browser based on <a href="http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/">Haystack</a>. Not sure if/how I would use it. But, an interesting idea.</p>
