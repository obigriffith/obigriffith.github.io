  <p>6 Dec 2007 - Hey gang. Not much time to write. Still writing my thesis. Bah - why won't it just write itself? Is that really too much to ask? Working on the introduction, which ironically means that I'm close to the end. I posted some new pictures of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600592559950/">visit from family</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157601770565379/">progress on the fence</a> (in snow conditions!), and some pics from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603389684332/">the Canucks game</a> I went to last month. In other news, Malachi's <a href="http://www.alexaplatform.org/%20">ALEXA</a> paper was accepted in Nature Methods. See the citation on my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page. Bye for now. </p>
  <p>17 Nov 2007 - Hi all. Sorry for the short post. Not much time. Writing my thesis, preparing a lesson on whole-genome cloning for 200 first-year biology students, developing a lesson on assessment schemes, and the slow crawl that is fence building. Also sick as a dog. But, if I can make it to the end of the month, things should improve dramatically. Plus, grandmere and two of my aunts are coming for a visit. Can't wait! :) <br>

  <p>5 Nov 2007 - Sorry for the long silence. I've been crazy busy trying to get my thesis written, submitting the ORegAnno paper, and various other research projects. I'm also taking a class on 'teaching and learning in the life sciences'. This past weekend I ran 14.4km in the <a href="http://www.bcathletics.org/H2H/" target="_top">Haney to Harrison race</a>. Should have some pictures soon. I've added a link (see left sidebar) to Malachi's new website for the <a href="http://www.AlexaPlatform.org" target="_top">ALEXA alternative splicing array platform</a>. This platform allows users to design advanced alternative splicing array designs for any Ensembl species. Very cool. I have also updated my publications and CV. Oh, and the fence building is still coming along. The entire backyard is now fenced in. We just need a gate in the back. The fence along the side of the house has not been started yet though. bah. :) </p>
  <p>15 Sept 2007 - Just finished week from hell. But, I got my ORegAnno paper submitted. Publication page is updated. Now, I'm gonna go drink some beer and stain my fence. See the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157601770565379/">fence progress</a> here. </p>
  <p>27 August 2007 - Yikes. A whole month since I posted anything. I guess I've been busy. Hard to remember all that's happened. I had a committee meeting which is at least part of the reason why I was too busy to post any news. I'm glad that's done. I now have permission to start writing up with a plan to be more or less finished by the end of the year (although the defence will probably have to wait until the new year). We've been slowly but surely getting some work done on the fence in the backyard. We have some holes dug, posts erected, and I just ordered all the remaining materials today. Once the fence is up we will turn our attention to the new decking. Lots of work to do! I saw The Fray at Deer Lake (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157601103397063/">flickr pics</a>) a while back and just got back from camping at Harrison Lake (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157601700099530/">flickr pics</a>) this weekend. But, now I have to get back at it. I have a paper to submit by Sept 15, taking a course on teaching in the biological sciences, and of course, I need to actually start writing my thesis up. That shouldn't be too bad though. I'm really looking forward to getting started on it actually. ttyl then. </p>
  <p>26 July 2007 - Don't have time to say much. Just checking in. I made a couple updates to my publications/presentations. I am crazy busy right now. I need to cut my book chapter down by 10 pages and like 60 references, write an ORegAnno database update paper, resubmit by subspace clustering paper, do a bunch of analysis of a collaborator, and get ready for my committee meeting next month. aaaahh! Here's some new music I'm listening to:<br>
      <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mutemath">Mute Math</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tokyopoliceclub">Tokyo Police Club</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/yellowcard">Yellowcard</a>. </p>
  <p>17 July 2007 - Hello again. Its been a while so I thought I'd post a quick update. My little sis took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600779686498/">pictures of the house where we grew up</a> whilst flying overhead in a plane. Last week I was helping to TA the CBW Genomics workshop. A grueling but rewarding experience. I updated my publications page. With some recent submissions, a major milestone was passed. I now have 20 publications (first or middle-author) not including patents or presentations. Only 11 of these appear in Pubmed for one reason or another. But, now I must get to work on some other projects. </p>
  <p>3 July 2007 - Hey. I posted some pictures to my flickr page of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600592598796/">Kid Koala concert</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600592550634/">our visit with Veronica in Gimli</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600592116475/">the great concrete demolition operation</a>. Kid Koala was awesome. You wouldn't believe how fast he can move his hands. The pictures are just blurry cell phone pics. So, you can't see much. Some of them are cool though. Busting up the concrete in the backyard was fun but hard work. We first rented a 14&quot; saw with some masonry blades to cut clean lines at the edges where we wanted to keep the concrete. We went through 5 blades, but the cuts ended up turning out really good. Then, we rented a small demolition hammer. After about 15mins we realized that it was never going to do the job so we went back and rented the full-size jack hammer. It was a lot of fun to operate. But, really hard on the body. My hands are still recovering from the vibrations. In other news, I'm determined to get my book chapter submitted today. So, I better get back at it. Bye for now. </p>
  <p>28 June 2007 - Hi all. Can't talk long. Working under deadline to get my bloody (I mean excellent and entirely blood-free) book chapter done. I went to Kokanee Glacier park last weekend and hiked up on to the glacier. We stayed at the Kokanee glacier cabin. Its an amazing cabin, really state of the art for back-country, hardly roughing it all. There's a new set of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600494906070/">kokanee pictures</a> on my flickr page. I've also uploaded some videos. There are two that show the panoramic view from on top of the battleship (<a href="files/video/MVI_1128_virt_dub_lq.AVI">with voice-over</a>, <a href="files/video/MVI_1129_virt_dub_lq.AVI">and without</a>) and one of <a href="files/video/MVI_1144_virt_dub_lq.AVI">Carri sliding down the glacier</a> (sorry for the profanity, I thought she was going to take me out). Enjoy! </p>
  <p>14 June 2007 - Just a quick update. I had my 'exit seminar' today. It sounds much more final than it really is. It does not mean I will be exiting any moment or that I won't be giving any more seminars. But, it does mean that I've jumped through one more hoop on my way to finishing my PhD. Woohoo!<br>
    New music I'm listening to right now: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thecribs">The Cribs</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lilymusic">Lily Allen</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/amywinehouse">Amy Winehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/feist">Feist</a>. Still loving: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/arcadefire">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/citizencope">Citizen Cope</a>. </p>
  <p>11 June 2007 - Hi all. I'm back from Winnipeg. I didn't get to see everyone I would have liked to but did have a great visit with most of my family. I put some pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600335163837/">the cottage at Albert beach</a> on my flickr page. Now, its back to work. I have my exit seminar on Thursday and a lot of other catching up to do. My <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page has also been updated. The Gordon Robertson's STAT1 binding paper was published in Nature Methods and Stephen Montgomery's rSNP detection paper was published in PLoS Computational Biology. </p>
  <p>28 May 2007 - Hey! I'm back from Sasquatch festival and trying to get stuff done before heading to Winnipeg. Sasquatch was awesome. Its an amazing venue, with really great acoustics. All seating was general and people were just sort of floating around from stage to stage. So, you could get right up close for a while, then go sit on the grass, then have some bbq chicken skewers and 24oz beers. :) The musical highlight for me was <a href="http://www.myspace.com/arcadefireofficial">Arcade Fire</a>. They put on an amazing performance. It seems like every member of the band can sing and play six instruments. And, their big style was really suited to a massive outdoor venue like the Gorge. The Beastie Boys instrumental session was also quite good. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/citizencope">Citizen Cope</a> was a new band that I heard and liked. Bjork was interesting (not being a huge fan) but a little bit low-key after a long day in the blazing heat and a few of drinks. The camping was a good party. There were cars and tents as far as the eye could see in all directions. Overall, a great experience that I would recommend to anyone. John Mayer at the Gorge next weekend would be amazing. There's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600275178938/">pictures from the Sasquatch weekend</a> at my Flickr page. For those of you in Winnipeg, I'll see you soon. Everyone else, ttyl. </p>

  <p>24 May 2007 - Just time for a quick update. I went wine touring in Osoyoos and Oliver on the weekend. The weather was fantastic and I sampled and purchased a lot of good wine. I put some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600250214346/">pictures of the trip</a> on my flickr page. Next stop, Sasquatch festival. I'm heading down tomorrow afternoon. Now, I have to make some serious progress on my book chapter. </p>
  <p>14 may 2007 - Hi all. Sorry I fell off the blogwagon. Not too much to report. Still working on my book chapter. Most of the literature review is done. I was distracted last week helping a collaborator with a colon cancer survival analysis and getting ready for a class visit on Friday as part of the Let's Talk Science program. We taught a grade 10 class about scientific research skills and tools (e.g. Pubmed). That was fun. Last weekend I went on a soggy hike to Brothers Creek after M and S's housewarming. That was a bit rough. Not sure if we ever found the right trail, and we almost got run over by some crazy north shore bikers, but it was fun. I posted a couple of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600211277770/">pictures on Flickr</a>. </p>
  <p>2 May 2007 - Went to the John Mayer concert last night at the PNE Coliseum. Judging by the (terrible cell phone camera) picture below it was a blindingly bright performance. Actually the show was really good. That guy can definitely play guitar. And, the view wasn't bad considering how far back we were. We had the front row in our section so there were no heads in the way. In other news, I bought a mp3 player! Nothing fancy. Just a Creative Zen Nano 1GB. I bought it over the ipod shuffle because it comes with FM receiver, voice recording, audio input recording, FM recording. And, it allows you to just drag and drop files onto it without any software. Although the software they do provide isn't bad. Plus, its cheaper. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/481964111/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/481964111_0e95ae5554.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="01-05-07_2059" /></a></p>
  <p>30 April 2007 - Ah Monday. How I missed you. But, on the bright side we've had three straight days of sunshine. A gorgeous weekend. I went to the Bloedel Conservatory (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600161029349/">flick pics</a>) in Queen Elizabeth park. It was a nice little tropical excursion. There was a crazy parrot there (presumably) called Charlie. Either that or he has a good friend named Charlie. I took a <a href="files/video/MVI_0661_rotated.AVI">video of him saying hello</a>. Warning, if you are afraid of birds you may find the footage a little scary. :-) I also started to work on the model ship that I brought back from Belgium. If you want to follow its progress, I've created a photo set for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600160968540/">Leida, the Dutch Yacht da diporto</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/478641733/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/214/478641733_23a24b1458.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="IMG_0657"/></a></p>
  <p>24 April 2007 - Happy Tuesday all. Lets see. What's new. My fundraising for the Vancouver Spring Sprint is going well. I'm at 76% of my goal of $500. You can help push me over the goal-line at <a href="https://secure.e2rm.com/registrant/StartUp.aspx?SID=1424157">my sponsor page</a>. The canucks won their first series after a nerve-wracking game seven. Great game actually. I went for a hike to Buntzen lake (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600118596569/">flickr pictures</a>) on the weekend. I picked up tickets to <a href="http://www.sasquatchfestival.com/">Sasquatch Festival</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gorge_Amphitheatre">the Gorge</a>. What I'm listening to: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thecomas">The Comas</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andrewbird">Andrew Bird</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/arcadefireofficial">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gymclassheroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>. Right now I'm doing a literature review for my book chapter on <em>Identification of Gene Expression Markers for Diagnosis</em>. But, soon I'll be swimming. :-) </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/470993668/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/470993668_47b3fa5682.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mossy" /></a></p>
  <p>20 April 2007 - Just a quick update. I finally submitted my subspace clustering paper! Fingers crossed. Now, time for a drink. Its Friday and my brain is cooked from the final submission exertion. Why does the stupid submission process have to be so onerous. ttyl. </p>
  <p>16 April 2007 - Hey again. I went to the Canucks game on Friday. We had seats in the lower bowl and a great view of the Canucks getting shutout. Damn it. But, they redeemed themselves last night by stealing one away in Dallas. I also went for the first rollerblade of the season on Saturday around Stanley Park with CL. I posted a nice shot of the north shore from prospect point using my camera's stitch-assist feature. I have some more pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600081490411/">Stanley Park at Flickr</a>. There's a few shots of the damage from wind storms earlier this year. I wish the sea-wall would open up completely (we had to take some detours on the road). But, I guess they have a lot of repair work to do. This weekend also saw the first golf-excursion of the year to Queen Elizabeth Pitch and Putt. I had a couple pars but otherwise it was fairly rough (pun intended).</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/461169822/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/461169822_1b88d5a56b.jpg" width="500" height="84" alt="North Shore from Prospect point" /></a></p>
  <p>13 April 2007 - Wow. I'm really on a role with updating my blog. Maybe I should actually set up a real blog (blogger.com or something). I joined team Butterfield for the Vancouver Spring Sprint run to raise money for the <a href="http://www.braintumour.ca">Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada</a>. If you would like to support this cause you can <a href="https://secure.e2rm.com/registrant/StartUp.aspx?SID=1424157">sponsor me here</a>. I've also recently been playing around in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a>. Its not hard to see why they call it crackbook. If you want to connect just <a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php?q=obi+griffith">search for my name</a> and add me to your friends list.</p>
  <p>10 April 2007 - Hey gang. I hope everyone had a good Easter long weekend. I sure did. I went to Nelson and Slocan. Lots of driving. But, my time there was very relaxing. The weather was amazing. Friday, Saturday and Sunday were all in the 20's. Most of the snow was gone except at higher elevation and in some dark shady spots. I went on some good hikes, took tons of pictures, and generally just enjoyed the peaceful quiet. I posted some pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600060974441/">Slocan</a> on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">my flickr</a> page.</p>

  <p>2 April 2007 - Hi again. Lets see. What's up. I went to the UBC 2007 Wine and Beer festival. That was fun. You $25 ticket pretty much buys you a license to drink as much as you want. The vendors were mostly Canadian mini-breweries. But, there was a smattering of international breweries, some local wineries and other miscellaneous stuff. On Saturday I went cross-country skiing (last time this year maybe?). It was a gorgeous sunny day with slushy but fast snow. I also found some time for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594341592972/">darkroom</a> and started developing a few of my commercial drive pics from a couple weekends ago. I like how the negs developed and some of the prints are coming together but the scanned images don't really reflect that too well. In real life, the prints are not nearly as dark as these scans appear. I should brighten them up in photoshop i guess. I tried doing he quick fix in adobe photo album but the image files were too large. That's what you get for scanning at 600dpi. oops. Anyways, you get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594341592972/">the idea</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/441763806/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/167/441763806_e85c262a50.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="razor_wire" /></a></p>
  <p> I also took a bunch of pictures on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72057594067889830/">digital at Van Dusen</a> gardens (mixed in with a few older pictures I had) on Sunday.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/442982808/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/442982808_c6654456bc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="blue flower forest" /></a></p>
  <p>27 Mar 2007 - I developed a bunch of negatives from last weekend. They look promising. I took about sixty pictures of people walking by on commercial drive and some other interesting sites around commercial drive. Hopefully I'll have some new prints from the darkroom on flickr soon.<br>

  <p>I also started checking out blueorganizer. Not sure if its any use to me yet. But, here's my bluebadge to give you an idea of what I've been bluemarking:</p>

  </p>
  <p>24 Mar 2007 - I went to the Canucks open practice. It was weird to be at GM Place again just a few hours after the concert last night. The tickets were free so they had a sellout crowd. Imagine ... a sell out at GM place for practice! Haha. Just goes to show how much Vancouver is into the Canucks right now. Of course, it helps that they're kicking ass this year. Go Canucks Go! Unfortunately, my camera ran out of batteries just before the practice started. Good thing I forgot my backup battery :-(. But, Kim got a bunch of good pictures like this one of Luongo taking a breather. Check out her flickr page for more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kimw/sets/72157600024709046/">pics from the Canucks practice</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="images/luongo.jpg" width="384" height="500"></p>
  <p>23 Mar 2007 - Went to the Clapton concert! We were seated on the floor, row 37. GM Place was sold out (of course) in a couple hours probably. Clapton was great. No chatting with the crowd though. He just came out and did his thing.</p>
  <p><img src="images/clapton.jpg" width="500" height="375"> </p>
  <p>21 Mar 2007 - I put up a video from my last ski trip to Cypress. <a href="files/temp/DanChi_skiing.AVI">Download it here</a>. </p>
  <p>12 Mar 2007 - I went skiing to Cypress with Dan (who was visiting) and my bro. It was very foggy but there was fresh snow and we had the place almost to ourselves. Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594580827919/">some pictures</a> from my very own digital camera. I've finally joined the world of digital cameras. I also took some last weekend at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594568177787/">Wreck beach</a> on another gloomy day. But, now its back to work. Less than a week until F1 starts again. I'm sure not many of you care too much about that. But, I'm excited!</p>
  <p>1 Mar 2007 - Wow. March! How did that happen? Its been a busy couple of weeks since my last news. I finally have my subspace clustering paper together in draft form. Just doing some final tweaks to the graphs and incorporating contributions from co-authors. Damn it will be nice to get that off. I'm also starting to work on a book chapter for a three-volume series in the field of 'Methods of cancer diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis'. The chapter will be called 'Thyroid cancer: identification of gene expression markers for diagnosis'. That should be interesting. Hopefully this will also form the framework for my thesis introductory chapter. Another paper I helped with was also submitted to Archives of Surgery on biomarkers involved in the transformation of differentiated to undifferentiated thyroid cancer. This is an interesting comparison because it involves a transition from one of the &quot;best&quot; cancers (in terms of prognosis) to one of the worst. What have i been doing for fun lately? I saw an amazing show by <a href="www.cie-dca.com/">Philippe Decoufl&eacute;</a> called Solo. If you get a chance, check it out. I've also been cross-country skiing again. I'm finally getting around to watching the very cool HBO series Band of Brothers. I also saw Pan's Labyrinth. Very cool but get ready for some gore. I've rarely experienced a more vocal or outwardly affected theatre audience.<br>

  <p>12 Feb 2007 - Hi there. I'm back. Since my last entry, I've been to Mount Baker and Florida. Mount Baker was pretty good. The weather didn't cooperate (icy on the first day and rainy on the second). But, the cabins were a lot of fun. The conference in Florida was good. Lots of talk about 'next-generation' sequencing. My own talk went well. And, the weather was fantastic. I even managed to get a bit of a sunburn on my face. Every lunch and dinner was outdoors on the 'sunset terrace' and I managed to fit in some sun-bathing. Now, I'm back in rainy Vancouver. And, even worse, back at work. :( </p>
  <p>31 Jan 2007 - Tomorrow I'm off to Baker. Still praying for snow. Here's a pic from cross-country skiing at Cypress on a perfect sunny day. Thanks for the skis Dan! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157594513501340/">More pics at Flickr</a> (courtesy of Monica). </p>

  <p>29 Jan 2007 - Hi all (assuming there's more than one person reading this). What's new? I went cross-country skiing this weekend at Cypress. It was a georgeous day and a ton of fun. For cross-country trails they were surprisingly hilly. They even had the same green circle, blue square, black diamond rating system as downhill runs. We braved one black diamond in the uphill direction and had some crazy runs down the blues. I discovered a few muscles i forgot about (the ones you use for snow-plowing). This weekend is the long awaited Mount Baker trip. Pray for snow. Here's a new feature for my blog.<br>

  <p>8 Jan 2007 - Back to work. Hurray! What a wonderful feeling to not have to suffer through holidays any longer. My New Year's resoluton is to always blog the opposite of what I really think (hey, it worked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposite_%28Seinfeld_episode%29">George Costanza</a> right?). Haha. Seriously though. Its good to be back in Vancouver. I drove into the interior and back through a lot of slush and snow. But, I was rewarded with some great downhill skiing in <a href="http://www.panoramaresort.com/index.htm">Panorama</a> and cross-country skiing in the Nelson area (a big thanks to DS for the new x-country skis). I also had some great visits with family and friends. <a href="http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp">Cypress</a> on Saturday was killer too. But, now its back to work. I have a &quot;Research in Progress&quot; talk tomorrow. Damn I better get to work on that. And, I just found out that my ORegAnno abstract was accepted for a talk at <a href="http://www.agbt.org/flash/about.html">AGBT</a> on Marco Island, Florida next month. Plus, I have about a million other things to work on. So, I better get back at it. Bye for now.</p>
