  <p>15 Oct 2008 - Just got back from Thanksgiving long weekend in Nelson/Slocan. Now, I'm getting ready to give a guest lecture on the nucleus and chromatin tomorrow. Other than that, I'm just doing lots of analysis. I've also been doing some labwork for the first time in years. I'm learning tissue culture and doing some cell proliferation assays to test some new cancer drugs and drug combinations. The yard continues to progress slowly. Last week we disposed of about 10 yards of spare soil from the patio excavation. This weekend we should be able to finally start laying down the paver stones. Just in time for winter. :) </p>

  <p>25 Aug 2008 - I posted some pictures of our latest renovation projects. We've put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157606946509182/">roof on our balcony</a> and are still working away at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157606946495428/">backyard patio</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/2796231537/in/set-72157600592559950/">My sister</a> recently moved in to the flat. Its been great having her around and getting to know her again. She took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598903/">pictures from around the house</a>. You can already see some of the effect she's had. In her room you can see the first personal touches (pictures on the wall) to grace our house. Right now, I'm trying to figure out how well the Solexa/Illumina sequencing worked for my Iressa-treated breast cancer cell line samples. But, my linux box has frozen. Should I restart? What did I have unsaved and open? Who knows... That's why I'm procrastinating with the blog posting. Maybe the turkey will work its way through. :) <br>
    What I'm listening to: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theswellseason">Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova (aka The Swell Season)</a> and the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/oncesoundtrack">'Once' soundtrack</a> </p>
  <p>11 Jul 2008 - Our paper on tissue microarray analysis of thryoid cancer is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18612701">now available</a> as an E-publication ahead of print. I have updated my <a href="../publications.html">publications page</a> accordingly. I have been helping my dad to develop a website for several properties in Honduras. Check it out at <a href="http://www.caribbeancottagecommunities.com/">www.caribbeancottagecommunities.com</a>. We have also made a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28280192@N04/">Flickr page</a> for this endeavour. Speaking of Flickr. Since my last post I have gone back and uploaded all kinds of pictures and videos. You can see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157605796407727/">complete video collection</a> or check out specific sets with videos like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603621665078/">Hawaii</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157605699312872/">Sasquatch Fest</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157605668737469/">Sproat Lake (Ben's stag)</a>, etc. There's also some pictures of our latest outdoor renovations. We built a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157605810146812/">drainage ditch</a> as part of our patio construction in the back yard. At work, I've also been  busy looking for viral sequences in Illumina whole transcriptome sequence data and trying to identify new drugs to test for lymphoma. And, I'm trying to line up some teaching activities for this fall. Stay tuned for potentially exciting developments in that area. Its funny that in my last post I was complaining about getting that thyroid marker panel review off. Well, I did get it submitted and the editor sent it to four external reviewers! That's a lot of reviewers for a review article. I mean, all we're doing is summarizing the current literature. Maybe the editors don't want a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/a_baffling_failure_of_peer_rev.php">Han-Warda controversy</a> on their hands. Don't worry, we won't try to slip in anything about how thyroid tumors are really the result of an &quot;Almighty Creator&quot;. Haha. So now I'm trying to get the revisions done and get it off again. It seems like I need to be procrastinating a really onerous task in order to post to my blog. :)<br>
    What I'm listening to these days: The new <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sigurros">Sigur Ros</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coldplay">Coldplay</a> albums. </p>
  <p>6 Jun 2008 - I'm busy finishing up a review of thyroid cancer biomarkers but I wanted to give you all a quick update. I received <a href="../files/PhD_diploma.pdf">my diploma (pdf scan) </a> today. Very cool. What a lot of trouble for that little piece of paper. haha. Too bad it doesn't say what its in (i.e., Medical Genetics). I've also updated my publications page with some recent developments. Our paper on the big tissue microrarray analysis of thyroid cancer was accepted for publication yesterday. My first 'last-author' paper! That's a big mile-stone and already makes my 'temporary' post-doc position here at the BCCRC seem a success. Before too long I'll have to start thinking about where I'm going next. But, for now, I'm trying to enjoy being a regular person in Vancouver. If only the weather would cooperate a little more. I'm also getting involved in some other interesting projects looking at pathogens in cancer using Illumina sequencing and doing some targetted drug discovery for follicular lymphoma. This fall I'd like to find some part-time teaching opportunities. On the fun side, I went to the Sasquatch music festival a couple of weekends ago. Pictures and videos should be available soon on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">my flickr page</a>. There are some new pictures there taken by Chi on his recent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157605417234121/">trip to San Diego</a> for Digestive Disease Week. Music I'm listening to these days: mostly stuff that I got hooked on at Sasquatch. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thenational">The National</a> were awesome and I also liked <a href="http://www.myspace.com/spearheadvibrations">Michael Franti and Spearhead</a>. That's all for now. Got to get this darn review off. :) </p>
  <p>6 May 2008 - As you might have guessed I sucessfully defended my thesis, completed all revisions, and submitted to the UBC library archives. Hooray! Everything went well and I'm really glad to be done. If you want to read <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2429/689">my thesis</a> you can find a pdf on the archive website. I have now started as a post-doc at the BC Cancer Research Centre while I figure out where to go next. I am finishing off some projects, starting some new Solexa and microarray analysis, and writing a review paper. That should keep me very busy for the next little while.I took a little time off to catch up on some yardwork (the fence is almost finished) and visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600060974441/">Slocan</a> and Nelson. If the weather improves, I will soon be working on landscaping the backyard. My publications page has been updated. </p>
  <p>28 Mar 2008 - In case anyone is interested, here are the details for my doctoral exam. You can also <a href="../files/Griffith_Programme_final.pdf">download the programme (pdf)</a>.  Maybe I'll see some of you there. Otherwise, wish me luck! </p>

  <p>26 Mar 2008 - One week until my doctoral exam! Yikes! Time to cross your fingers and toes people. I should probably be studying instead of making this post. But, I just wanted to give you all the link to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7285278@N03/sets/72157604229855318/">pictures from our recent Mount Baker trip</a> (courtesy of CL). The conditions were awesome. The first day had decent fresh snow and was sunny and warm. The second day we had poor visibility but crazy amounts of powder and the mountain almost to ourselves. Now back to the pile of papers.<br>
    What I'm listening to (while studying): <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gnarlsbarkley">Gnarls Barkley</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tokyopoliceclub">Tokyo Police Club</a></p>
  <p>16 Mar 2008 - Not much time for news. I'm busy studying for my doctoral exam on April 2nd. Can't wait until that's over and done with. I've updated my <a href="../publications.html">publications</a> page with a few recently submitted and accepted manuscripts including my first &quot;senior&quot;-author publication. I've also posted some new pics on Flickr of some recent outings to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157604002307389/">Victoria</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603998403440/">Mount Finlayson</a> on Vancouver Island. Now, back to the studying...<br>
    What I'm listening to at the moment: Vangelis - Blade Runner Trilogy, 25th Anniversary, 3-disc set</p>
  <p>27 Feb 2008 - Sorry once again for the long break in postings. I've been busy wrapping up my thesis. Its is now submitted for examination. w00t! If you want to start a really big fire, or have a table with a really short leg, you can download the <a href="http://obiweb.bcgsc.ca/obigriffith/thesis/Griffith_OL_PhD_thesis_revised.pdf">whole 217 page summary of my last 4.5 years of research activity</a>. I'm scheduled to defend on April 2. Holy crap! I better get studying. At the moment I'm helping Sam with a big paper on the thyroid cancer tissue microarray analysis we've been doing. Its a nice break from thesis writing. Last weekend I went to the island for some hiking, relaxing, and fine dining. I should have some pictures for that on Flickr soon. I've also been working on the fence and other stuff around the house. <br>

  <p>30 Jan 2008 - Hi all. This weekend I went boarding and cross-country skiing in Whistler. We stayed at Edgewater Lodge (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603812966782/">flickr pics</a>) and had excellent snow conditions. Malachi's ALEXA paper on alternative splicing and chemotherapy resistence has just appeared in Nature Methods. If you have access, check it out at the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n2/full/nmeth0208-118.html">nature methods webpage</a> or contact him for reprint. At the moment there is some kind of police incident up at UBC in the BioSciences building. Thankfully, I'm not on campus (in case anyone heard about it and was concerned). I had a class in that building last term and was planning to go up there this week to pick up an assignment. I hope everything's ok.</p>
  <p>16 Jan 2008 - Another year, another page for my blog. Its been a while since I've posted last and lots has happened. The number one, big thing, is that I finished writing my thesis and sent if off to my committee. Now, I just have to address any revisions they feel are necessary. And of course, lots of paperwork and scheduling to deal with. But, for the moment I am enjoying a brief respite in which I can catch up on some actual research and enjoy life a little more. Speaking of enjoying life, I have just returned from vacations to the interior (Nelson/Slocan) and the Big Island of Hawaii. Both were excellent. We had bad weather driving both ways on our trip to Nelson, but thanks to DS we now have excellent winter tires. That should make the drives up to Cypress, Whistler etc a lot less hairy. Hopefully it will also mean no more fun with the chains this season. Thanks man! There are some new winter shots of Chi and I cross-country skiing and moon-gazing in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157600060974441/">Slocan valley set</a>. And, of course, there are tons of pictures from Hawaii. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603621665078/">Hawaii set</a> contains all 230 pics (filtered down from more than a thousand taken). But, if that's too overwhelming, you can also browse them by activity/location. Our home base was a nice 2-bedroom condo at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603741953423/">Paniolo Greens in Waikoloa village</a>. This was up the hill from the coast about 10km, right on a golf course, with a conveniently located market, hot tub, pool, bbq, and so on. We started our first day with breakfast, drinks and sunbathing at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603680435787/">the Hilton</a>, one of the few places with a restaurant open on New Years day. Next, we went up the coast for snorkeling at Keauhou Bay and sightseeing at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603662510287/">Pu'uhonua O Honaunau</a>, the &quot;place of refuge&quot;. A drive up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603657927156/">Saddle Road with the top down</a> and then some &quot;offroading&quot; took us to the breathtaking (and freezing cold) views and stargazing from the 14,000ft high <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603657895890/">Mauna Kea summit</a>. A longer excursion to the eastern coast allowed us to explore the city of Hilo, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603691201769/">Akaka falls</a>, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603686813840/">Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603738074660/">thermal pools</a> near the deceased town  of Kopoho (under a lava flow). Not satisfied with just easy-access snorkeling, we headed out in sea kayaks to visit the Captain Cook monument and excellent fish/coral viewing of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603691214587/">Kealakekua Bay</a>. What better way to relax from these busy day trips than the nearby <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603734812959/">Anaehoomalu Bay</a> (or &quot;A-bay&quot; for the linguistically challenged) complete with gorgeous beach, traditional Hawaiian fish ponds, &quot;jungle-beach-gym&quot;, and incredible sunsets. Our last big excursion was the requisite trip to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603734855233/">Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</a> for its volcanoes, lava tubes, craters, steam vents and more. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603734861129/">Thurston lava tube</a> was especially cool. Thank goodness for headlamps. Finally, while waiting for our late night flight home we discovered the little gem that is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603731005916/">Beach 69</a>. It had it all. Twisted trees, killer surf, rainbows, and our last amazing Hawaiian sunset. You can see a whole collection of them in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/72157603680462503/">Hawaii skies and sunsets</a> set. Enjoy the pictures. I sure enjoyed taking and living them. :) More news to follow as I reluctantly come back to reality. Bye for now. </p>
  <p>props to my bro for taking this great shot on our last day. </p>
