  <p>21 Dec 05 - ORegAnno appeared in Stew's '<a href="http://www.ghastlyfop.com/blog/2005/11/open-regulatory-annotation-database.html">Flags and Lollipops</a>' bioinformatics blog. Its amazing how things get around. Some interesting stuff on that blog though. I'll probably check back there again. Maybe when ORegAnno is published it can be discussed in more detail. </p>
  <p>17 Dec 05 - Hi there. Haven't checked in for a while. Just getting over a wicked cold (which I've now passed off to my unfortunate brother). Not too much to report in the research department. Working on revisions for the ORegAnno paper, trying to get thyroid cancer paper finished, and working on a poster for the PSB conference. Maui here I come! We've rented a van for the gang so we're ready to go exploring. Just got some pictures developed. Check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/">flick album</a>. There's new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/">photo sets</a> for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598855/">our last visit to Slocan</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598795/">the new Cancer Research Centre</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598903/">autumn on Clark Drive (pictures of our neighborhood)</a>. There's also one picture of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obigriffith/sets/1598827/">renovations</a> - more to come of those when the next roll is developed. Credit to MG - many of these pictures were taken by him. Enjoy. </p>
  <p>5 Dec 05 - Good news. The <a href="http://www.oreganno.org">ORegAnno</a> paper was accepted for publication in the journal Bioinformatics. It has received a lot of good feedback lately and the reviewers were very positive. I've also been helping some collaborators with a colon cancer survival analysis. That was fun. Now, its back to the thyroid cancer meta-analysis paper and dealing with reviewers comments on the ORegAnno paper. Christmas is coming soon so I'll have to make a poster for the PSB conference in Hawaii. Can't wait to escape the rain and fog of Vancouver for a little while. Went snow-shoeing on the weekend. Check out the pics from Mount Seymour <a href="http://137.82.19.130/personal/Steve/Seymour/index.html">here</a> and <a href="http://community.webshots.com/album/517919614nhOftU">here</a>. I love being able to drive 30 minutes and find 3 foot deep snow! We had a <a href="http://137.82.19.130/personal/Steve/Seymour/pages/IMG_6876.html">good turnout</a> on our first <a href="http://www.bcgsc.ca/mailman/listinfo/gschikers">gschikers</a> hike for a while. After my first taste of snow this weekend I can't wait to do some downhill skiing. We'll be going to Sun Peaks in February but I hope I can get some practice in at the local hill before then. </p>
  <p>22 Nov 05 - What news you ask? Well, my MSFHR application has been submitted and my committee meeting is done with. That's a relief. I'm giving a talk at the BC Cancer Agency on Thursday morning. ORegAnno has been getting a lot of positive feedback. </p>
  <p>13 Nov 05 - I can't believe I never posted this update yet. The renovations are officially done. Sure, there's always more. But, all the big stuff is finished and furniture has started to move in. stay tuned for pictures at some point. As for research news - I've been much preoccupied with MSFHR and preparing for a committee meeting this tuesday. Once that's done, its back to work. Some papers to write and lots of questions to ask and answer. The <a href="http://www.oreganno.org">ORegAnno</a> resource is coming along (lots of new records) and the paper is currently under review. Fingers crossed.</p>
  <p>8 Nov 05 - Bleh. Home sick today. Couldn't have come at a worse time too. So much to do. The details for the annual <a href="images/SunPeaks2006.jpg">GSC and friends ski trip</a> have been worked out. Check out the poster for all the details [ <a href="images/SunPeaks2006.jpg">jpg</a> | <a href="files/SunPeaks2006.pdf">pdf</a> ].</p>
  <p>24 Oct 05 - Hi again. Its interesting to look at my previous entry and see how things played out. The OregAnno paper has been submitted, rejected and re-submitted since my last entry. The thyroid meta-analysis paper is getting closer as well. Just sent off an abstract to the <a href="http://psb.stanford.edu/">Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing </a> in January on Maui - can't wait to go there. Most of the details are arranged. Amazingly, after a lot of work, the hardwood installation can still be described as &quot;almost complete&quot;. The baseboards are all up and the transition pieces are cut and stained. Now, there's just a bunch of polyfilling and touch-up painting. The F1 season did go down to the wire with a fairly entertaining final race in China. And, now we are in the non-F1 season. But, the Canucks are kicking ass and I'm staying alive in the hockey pool despite two injuries. Who'd have thought Sundin would take one in the eye in his first regular game of the season. And, what's with Bure listed as &quot;day-today&quot; with a back injury for like 3 weeks now! Anyways, we're having a hockey pubnight at Original Joes on thursday to see the Canuck's (and Bertuzzi's) first return to Colorado since the infamous Moore incident. Should be interesting.</p>
  <p>11 Oct 05 - Lots of good news today. The <a href="http://www.cisred.org">cisRED</a> paper was accepted for publication in <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/">Nucleic Acids Research</a>. It will be appearing in the annual database issue. The <a href="http://www.oreganno.org">ORegAnno</a> paper is also close to being ready for submission and the website is now publicly alive at <a href="http://www.oreganno.org">www.oreganno.org</a>. More good news - the hardwood installation is almost complete. All the wood is down. Just trim/transition pieces and baseboards to go! Can't wait to move completely into the house after more than one year of renovations. Had a tasty thanksgiving ham on Sunday courtesty of Monica, Kim and others. Check out Ben <a href="images/HAM_2005.JPG">carving it up</a>. There was also a great F1 race this weekend. The best in recent memory actually. Looks like its going to go down to the wire in the constructors championship between Mclaren and Renault. Only one more race to go and then we enter the depressing off-season. At least there's hockey. Now, back to work (or what passes for work on the day back from a long weekend). </p>
  <p>03 Oct 05 - Bleh. Monday. I feel like I need a weekend to help me recover from my weekend. Spent 24 hours doing renovations (4 on Friday, 10 on Saturday and Sunday each). That $1500 professional installation is starting to sound worthwhile eh? Too bad I don't have the $1500. We had to set up a big tarp in the backyard so that we could operate our home-made table-saw out of the rain. It was kind of nice actually (sawing in the rain). The floor's starting to look really great. Its about 2/3 done (not including trim). Its amazing how you can lay down a dozen rows in 2 hours and then spend another 2 hours working on a single row. It all depends on what obstacles you come across. Going around the fireplace was epic. Glad we only have one of those. Heh. A friend forwarded a <a href="http://shovelbums.org/component/option,com_mospetition/Itemid,506/">petition</a> concerning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">intelligent design</a> debate. Its a messy business. On a lighter note. Hockey starts on wednesday. First regular season game for the Canucks (vs Phoenix). Finally my rabbit ears will get some use again. :) </p>
  <p>27 Sept 05 - Gotta get the hang of this weblog thing. What's new in the world. We have a new governor general. That's something right. More importantly, we have a new F1 World Champion - Congrats to Fernando Alonso for finally bringing Schumi's reign of terror to an end. Next couple of races should be interesting. <a href="http://smweb.bcgsc.ca">Monty</a> has made a bunch of improvements to <a href="http://www.oreganno.org">ORegAnno</a>. But unfortunately they are only available internally right now. Stay tuned.</p>
  <p>22 Sept 05 - Well. I've sunk to a new low. I've put advertisements from <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">google adsense</a> on my page. I feel so dirty. On the other hand, its for a good cause. Every time you click an ad, a starving grad student earns a few pennies. Let me know if they cause any display problems or if you see any other bugs. My page definitely behaves differently in some browsers (especially IE). But, you should be using <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a> anyways.</p>
  <p>21 Sept 05 - Finally making another update to the page. In personal news, we are almost ready to put down the hardwood flooring in our house. In related news I've now reached new depths of brokeness.</p>
  <p>12 Aug 05 - Still tweaking the website. Some good news. Our long awaited coexpression paper is now available online in the '<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08887543" target="_blank">Articles in Press' section of the Genomics</a> journal. </p>
  <p>11 Aug 05 - This site is all new as I'm sure you can tell.</p>
